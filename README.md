# Residential Property Visualization

UK housing market has hit a new record high of Â£254,822 in December 2021 which is an increase of 10.4% over the year and a largest annual increase since 2006.

<code>Property visualizer</code> is a simple Python interface that allows the user to scrape property listings from a website, store them in Pandas dataframe which can be visualized as a dot map with Google API, Branca and Folium.
